A theme for Etherpad for harmony in GlocalMotion

## Installing

- The recommended way is
  npm install PATH/TO/THIS/FOLDER (from your etherpad-lite folder)

- But in actuality there are a few bugs regarding the admin manager currently so copying directly to ETHERPAD/node_modules is the way to go for now


## Todos

There should likely be a universal glo theme that we load via npm and compile in with our sass via node-sass includepaths
for maintainability across GlocalMotion and then keep etherpad specific things here.
